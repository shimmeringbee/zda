## Background

The Zigbee Device Adapter is a suite of libraries and functions to manage the abstraction from Zigbee Nodes to Shimmering Bee devices.

## Install

Add an import and most IDEs will `go get` automatically, if it doesn't `go build` will fetch.

```go
import "github.com/shimmeringbee/zda"
```

## Usage

**This libraries API is unstable and should not yet be relied upon.**

This piece of software is not ready for general use.
